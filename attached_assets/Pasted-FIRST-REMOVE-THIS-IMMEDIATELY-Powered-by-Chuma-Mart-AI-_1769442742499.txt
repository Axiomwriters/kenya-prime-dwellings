FIRST: REMOVE THIS IMMEDIATELY

“Powered by Chuma Mart AI”

No debate.

Why?

You’re building PropertyHub, not a reseller.

That line kills authority.

Partners will ask: “So who actually owns the user?”

Replace with ONE of these (pick one):

Smart Materials Engine

Project-Aware Materials

Built for Kenyan Projects

Or nothing at all (silence = premium)

Big brands don’t explain themselves. They let the product talk.

🧠 WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT (KEEP IT)

Let’s give credit where it’s due:

✅ “Build smarter.” headline → strong
✅ Project selector visible → excellent context
✅ Horizontal categories → modern
✅ Add to Project CTA → correct mental model
✅ Clean cards → premium feel

You’re on the right road. Now we widen the road.

1️⃣ ADD: MATERIAL COMPLETENESS (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Right now it feels… demo-ish.

A builder should land here and think:

“Oh, everything is here.”

Expand categories like this (no new UI needed):
Cement & Aggregates

Cement (multiple grades)

Sand (river / murram)

Ballast

Hardcore

Concrete blocks

Steel & Metal

TMT bars (8–32mm)

Binding wire

Steel mesh

I-beams / angle bars

Roofing

Mabati (gauges + profiles)

Clay tiles

Gutters & downpipes

Trusses

Plumbing

Pipes (PVC, PPR)

Fittings

Tanks

Sanitary ware

Electrical

Cables (by gauge)

Switches & sockets

DB boards

Lighting

Finishing

Tiles

Paint

Doors & frames

Gypsum & ceilings

Prefab

Panels

Cabins

Modular units

Even if some SKUs are placeholders — breadth builds trust.

2️⃣ ADD: “SMART SETS” (LOW EFFORT, HUGE WIN)

Above product grid, add chips like:

🧱 Foundation Set

🏗 Superstructure Set

🏠 Roofing Set

🎨 Finishing Set

Clicking a set:

Auto-filters materials

Shows “This set covers X% of your project”

This instantly makes the shop feel intent-aware.

3️⃣ EVOLVE THE PRODUCT CARD (WITHOUT CLUTTER)

Current card is good — just missing intelligence.

Add ONE subtle line under price:

Est. needed for your project: 220 bags

Grey text. Quiet confidence.

Hover state:

“Why?” → tooltip explanation

This alone separates you from 99% of shops.

4️⃣ PROJECT CONTEXT SHOULD FEEL ALIVE

Right now “Active Project” is static.

Let’s juice it up 👇

When a project is selected:

Show a tiny progress bar

Materials covered: 32%

Tooltip:

“You’ve added foundation materials”

Psychology: users want to complete things.

5️⃣ ADD A FLOATING PROJECT SUMMARY (GAME-CHANGER)

Bottom-right (desktop only):

🧱 Project Cart

12 items

KSh 1,240,000

View materials →

This should:

Slide in, not redirect

Feel like a control panel, not a checkout

Mobile: bottom sticky bar.

6️⃣ SUPPLIER TRUST (DON’T OVERDO IT)

Right now suppliers are invisible.

Add:

Supplier name (small)

⭐ rating

“Verified Supplier” badge (same logic as pros)

No bios. No walls of text.
Trust ≠ noise.

7️⃣ SEARCH SHOULD BE PROJECT-AWARE (LATER PHASE, BUT PLAN IT)

When someone types:

“cement”

Results should rank by:

Project relevance

Proximity to site

Stock availability

Even if backend isn’t ready — design for it now.

8️⃣ MICROCOPY TWEAKS (SMALL BUT POWERFUL)

Replace generic text:

“In Stock” → Available near site

“Low Stock” → Limited near Nakuru

“Add to Project” (keep) but on hover:

“Adds recommended quantity”

Words = UX.

9️⃣ BRAND CHECK (REAL TALK)

This page already feels:

More premium than Jiji

Smarter than Chuma Mart

Cleaner than most proptech sites

Once you:

Remove external branding

Add intelligence signals

Increase material depth

You’re no longer “trying something”.

You’re setting the standard.
