🧠 BUILD CONCIERGE (AI-FIRST, SHOP SECOND)

The shop doesn’t disappear.
It becomes the execution layer behind a concierge.

Think:

“Tell me what you’re building.”
Not “Pick cement.”

1️⃣ ENTRY POINT (HOW USERS START)

Instead of landing on products, users see:

💬 Build Concierge

“What are you building?”

Quick-start chips:

🏠 3-Bedroom Bungalow

🏢 Apartments

🏗 Rental Units

🌱 Just estimating costs

🧱 I already have drawings

No pressure. No jargon.

2️⃣ THE CONVERSATION FLOW (THIS IS THE MAGIC)
Step 1: Understand the Project

AI asks (progressively, not all at once):

Location (county + area)

Budget range

Floors

Timeline

Using a professional? (yes/no)

Every answer:

Updates project model in real time

Prepares materials + services silently

Step 2: Smart Suggestions (NOT QUESTIONS)

Instead of:

“What cement do you want?”

AI says:

“For a 3-bedroom maisonette in Nakuru, you’ll typically need ~220 bags of cement.
Would you like me to add the recommended set?”

Buttons:

✅ Add Recommended

✏️ Customize

💬 Explain why

This is confidence UX.

3️⃣ CONCIERGE → PROJECT → SHOP (SEAMLESS)

Behind the scenes:

AI creates a Project

Materials auto-populate

Services (architect, QS, surveyor) are suggested

User never sees:

Categories

Filters

Overchoice

But power users can still switch to “Manual View”.

4️⃣ THE PROJECT BOARD (VISUAL, NOT CART)

After chat, user lands on:

🧱 Project Board

Sections:

Materials (grouped by phase)

Services needed

Estimated total cost

Timeline

Everything editable.
Nothing locked.

This feels like Notion + Builder’s Bible.

5️⃣ CONCIERGE FOR PROS TOO (BIG WIN)

Architects / Contractors get:

“Chat with Project”

AI helps them:

Estimate materials

Quote faster

Adjust specs for budget

This reduces:

Back-and-forth

Ghosting

Price disputes

Pros love speed. You give them speed.

6️⃣ REVENUE INSERTION (SNEAKY BUT CLEAN)

Concierge enables monetization without friction:

“Want a verified contractor for this build?”
→ lead fee

“Optimize materials to save 12%?”
→ premium AI

“Lock prices & escrow delivery?”
→ transaction fee

No hard selling.
Just “Do you want this handled?”

7️⃣ WHY THIS IS A MOAT 🛡️

Competitors:

Lists

Prices

Vendors

You:

Understanding

Guidance

Control

Once someone starts a build with your concierge:
👉 they cannot easily leave.

8️⃣ DESIGN DIRECTION (IMPORTANT)

UI rules:

Chat on left

Project summary on right (live updating)

Soft transitions

Calm tone

No chatbot vibes.
This is a professional assistant, not “Hey bestie”.

STRAIGHT TALK (NO SUGAR)

If you do this right:

You don’t compete with Chuma Mart

You absorb them

You become the default starting point for building in Kenya
