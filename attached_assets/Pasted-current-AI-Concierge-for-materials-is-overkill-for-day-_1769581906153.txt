current AI Concierge for materials is overkill for day-1 users.

Kenyan users want:

“Nahitaji lorry ya mchanga”

“Nipe simiti ya Bamburi 50 bags”

“Nijenge 3-bedroom, nipee estimate”

👉 They want speed + clarity, not therapy sessions with AI.

✅ The correct model (THIS is the move)

ONE AI GENIE

Background brain

Not always a chat UI

TWO ENTRY MODES

Smart Warehouse (Primary)

AI Assist (Contextual, optional)

AI should assist, not block buying.

3️⃣ NEW BUILDING MATERIALS EXPERIENCE (FULL REVAMP)
Rename it (important)

❌ “Build Concierge”
❌ “Powered by Chuma Mart”

✅ PropertyHub Smart Warehouse
Subtitle: Materials. Logistics. Done right.

🟢 Submit Order for Fulfillment

Not “Pay Now”.

This protects:

Pricing fluctuations

When user clicks Submit Order → modal pops.

Fields (short, Kenyan-friendly)

Full name

Phone number

🟢 Confirm Order

🎯 This keeps YOU in control before money moves.

8️⃣ Where AI Fits (Smart, not annoying)
AI Genie runs in the background to:

Validate quantities

Flag unrealistic orders

Suggest add-ons:

“You may need cement with this sand”

Estimate project totals

Route to verified suppliers

Alert reps with context

Optional AI entry:

🧠 Not sure what you need? Ask Genie

This opens chat without hijacking the flow.

9️⃣ ONE AI GENIE (Answering your big question)

Yes — ONE AI handles:

Property search

Rentals

Land

Build estimation

Materials

Professional matching

How?

By intent routing, not multiple bots.

Example:

“I want to build a 3-bedroom bungalow in Nakuru”

Genie does:

Recognizes BUILD_INTENT

Asks 2–3 clarifying questions

Generates:

Rough cost

Materials list

Pushes list → Smart Warehouse cart

Offers:

Professionals

Financing

Trips

One brain. Many outputs.

🔟 Why this beats competitors (real talk)
Platform	What they do
Chuma Mart	Simple e-commerce
Jiji / FB	Chaos
Contractors	Manual, opaque
PropertyHub	Decision + logistics + trust

You’re not selling cement.
You’re selling certainty.

Final Take (No sugarcoating)

Kill “Powered by Chuma Mart”

Kill chat-first buying

Lead with Smart Warehouse

Keep AI as an invisible advantage

Always insert a human checkpoint before payment
