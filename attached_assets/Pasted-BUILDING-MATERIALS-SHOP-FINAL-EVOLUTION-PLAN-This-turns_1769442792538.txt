BUILDING MATERIALS SHOP — FINAL EVOLUTION PLAN

This turns the shop from “nice UI” into the backbone of the ecosystem.

1️⃣ PROJECT CART (SLIDE-IN CONTROL PANEL)

This is not checkout. This is command center energy.

UI

Bottom-right floating button
🧱 Project Materials (12 items · KSh 1.24M)

Click → smooth slide-in from right (desktop)

Mobile → bottom sheet

Inside the Slide-In

Project name + location

Materials grouped by phase:

Foundation

Superstructure

Roofing

Finishing

Each item shows:

Quantity

Supplier

Delivery ETA

Actions:

“Optimize Cost”

“Request Supplier Quotes”

“Proceed to Escrow”

💡 Why this wins:
Users feel like they’re managing a build, not shopping.

2️⃣ MATERIAL QUANTITY INTELLIGENCE (CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)

This is where competitors lose.

How quantities are calculated

Based on:

Project type (bungalow / maisonette / apartments)

Size (sqm)

Floors

County (material norms vary)

Building standards (Kenya-specific)

Example

Bamburi Cement

Est. needed for your project: 220 bags

Hover → explanation:

“Based on 3-bedroom maisonette, 2 floors, Nakuru standards.”

This builds trust + authority instantly.

3️⃣ SMART SETS (ONE-CLICK MAGIC)

4️⃣ SUPPLIER TRUST & ONBOARDING RULES

No random suppliers. Ever.

Supplier Requirements

Business registration

County delivery zones

Stock reporting (weekly)

Pricing transparency

Supplier Badge System

✅ Verified Supplier

🚚 Delivers to Nakuru

⭐ Rating (jobs completed, not reviews spam)

Suppliers don’t own the customer.
You do.

5️⃣ SEARCH & FILTERING (PROJECT-AWARE)

Search results ranked by:

Project compatibility

Delivery proximity

Stock availability

Supplier reliability

Filters:

Available near site

Fits my project

Bulk discount

Fast delivery

This feels intelligent, not e-commerce.

6️⃣ WEBFLOW INTERACTIONS (PREMIUM FEEL)
Micro-interactions to add:

Add to Project → button morph + checkmark

Quantity auto-fills (with subtle animation)

Progress bar updates in real time

Tooltips fade in, not pop

Motion Rule:

If it moves → it informs.
No pointless animation.

7️⃣ ESCROW-READY (FUTURE-SAFE)

Even if payments come later, design for it now.

Flow preview:

Materials added

Suppliers confirmed

Funds held in escrow

Release on delivery confirmation

This protects:

Users

You

Serious suppliers only

8️⃣ BRAND POSITIONING (FINAL WORD)

After this:

You’re not “Chuma Mart but online”

You’re BuildOS for Kenya

PropertyHub becomes the operating system of property

Quiet. Confident. Dangerous (to competitors)
