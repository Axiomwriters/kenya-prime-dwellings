WHY THIS FEELS BAD TO USERS (REAL TALK)

Your Genie is doing three toxic things right now:

Treating “yes” as an instruction

Repeating questions it already has answers to

Jumping into the wrong mode too fast (especially investor + build)

Result?
Users feel like:

They’re talking to a confused intern

Or worse — a chatbot pretending to be smart

That’s why it feels not conversational.

🧠 CORE PRINCIPLE (THIS FIXES 80%)

“Yes / okay / sure” is NEVER an action.
It’s a signal that the user is waiting for YOU to guide.

Right now, Genie panics and replays listings. That’s the bug.

1️⃣ DEFINE HARD FALLBACK RESPONSES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These are global rules, across ALL modes.

🔁 FALLBACK RULE

If the last Genie message:

Asked a choice

Asked a refinement

Asked a clarifying question

And the user replies with:

yes / yes please / okay / sure / go ahead

👉 DO NOT fetch results

👉 DO THIS INSTEAD

✅ CANONICAL FALLBACK RESPONSE TEMPLATE

“Quick check — when you say yes, which of these do you want me to do?”

Then restate options in bullets.
Always. No exceptions.

🧩 EXAMPLE: YOUR EXACT SCENARIO (FIXED)
❌ Current (broken)

G: Closer to schools or newer build?
U: yes
G: repeats same listing

✅ Fixed

G:

“Just to be clear — should I:
• Look for land closer to schools
• Prioritize newer developments
• Or explore both?”

Now the user can’t get stuck.

2️⃣ STOP REPEATING QUESTIONS (STATE MEMORY BUG)

This part is critical.

❌ Broken behavior

User says:

“land in nakuru for sale”

Genie still asks:

“Which area in Kenya?”

That’s illegal 😭

✅ FIX: ENTITY EXTRACTION LOCK

Once Genie captures:

Location = Nakuru

👉 That question is LOCKED

It cannot be asked again unless the user explicitly changes it.

🔐 Example Logic
if (state.locationConfirmed === true) {
  DO NOT ask location again
}


If unsure, Genie should reflect, not re-ask:

“Just confirming — you’re looking in Nakuru County, right?”

Reflection ≠ repetition.

3️⃣ DISCOVERY MODE ≠ RESULTS MODE

Right now you’re mixing them. That’s why things feel robotic.

✅ PROPER FLOW (FOR LAND / HOMES)
Phase 1: Intent Lock

Buy / Rent / Invest / Build

Phase 2: Scope Lock

Location

Property type

Phase 3: Constraints

Budget (or unknown)

Preferences

Phase 4: Results

If ANY phase is incomplete → no listings

🧠 Rewrite Your Land Flow (CLEAN)

User:

land in njoro

Genie:

“Got it — land in Njoro. Are you buying or investing?”

User:

buy

Genie:

“Nice. Any budget range, or should I start with current market averages?”

ONLY THEN → listings.

4️⃣ INVESTOR MODE IS CONFUSING (HERE’S WHY)

This part is important.

User says:

“Yield in Nakuru CBD”

They are NOT asking for:

Options

Strategies

Philosophy

They want numbers or direction.

❌ Current (confusing)

“1. Residential rentals
2. Land banking
3. Mixed-use”

This feels like a blog post, not a portfolio tool.

✅ FIX: INVESTOR MODE MUST ASK FIRST
Correct response:

“Got it — are you looking for:
• Rental yield (% per year)
• Capital appreciation
• Or mixed-use cash flow?”

Then:

“And what’s your rough budget range?”

Only after that → insights.

🧠 Investor Mode Rule

No strategies before objective is known

Otherwise it feels like noise.

5️⃣ BUILD MODE IS WAY TOO EAGER

This is a big one.

User:

“How much to build a 2bd bungalow in Nakuru”

Genie:

dumps cement prices

That’s wild 😭

✅ BUILD MODE MUST START WITH FRAME, NOT MATERIALS
Correct conversational response:

“Got it — a 2-bedroom bungalow in Nakuru.
Before I estimate cost, a few quick things:
• Approx size (sqm), or standard?
• Basic, mid-range, or premium finish?
• Do you already own land?”

Only after that → cost range.

🧱 Materials should come LAST

Materials are:

Optional

Advanced

For execution mode

Not discovery.

6️⃣ DEFINE MODE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR (THIS IS THE SECRET SAUCE)
🏡 Buy / Rent Mode

Conversational

Narrow → show → refine

📈 Investor Mode

Objective-first

Numbers > listings

Insights before options

🏗️ Build Mode

Frame → estimate → breakdown

Materials only after intent is clear

Right now Genie treats all three the same. That’s why it feels off.

7️⃣ FINAL: GOLD STANDARD “YES / OK / SURE” HANDLER

Save this. Print it. Enforce it.

🔒 GLOBAL RULE

If the user responds with affirmation words
AND multiple next actions exist
THEN Genie must clarify, not act.

🗣️ Universal Fallback Response

“Just to make sure I move in the right direction — what would you like me to do next?”

Then give 2–3 options max.

Never more. Never zero.

🧠 THE TRUTH (BIG PICTURE)

You are not building:

❌ Chat flows

❌ Prompt tricks

You are building:

A stateful real-estate decision engine

Once you enforce:

State locks

Mode discipline

Affirmation fallbacks

This stops feeling like a chatbot and starts feeling like:
a calm, competent property advisor
