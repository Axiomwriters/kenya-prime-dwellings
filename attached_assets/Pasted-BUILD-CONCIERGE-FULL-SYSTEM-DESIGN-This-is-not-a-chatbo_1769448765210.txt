BUILD CONCIERGE — FULL SYSTEM DESIGN

This is not a chatbot.
It’s a guided construction intelligence flow that controls money, materials, and trust.

1️⃣ FULL CONCIERGE CONVERSATION SCRIPT (PRIMARY FLOW)
🟢 System Greeting (Fixed)

Habari! I’m your Build Concierge.
Tell me what you’re building and I’ll handle estimates, materials, and sourcing.

STEP 1: PROJECT TYPE (User Intent)

Quick chips (already perfect on your UI):

🏠 3-Bedroom Bungalow

🏢 Apartments

🏗 Rental Units

💰 Just estimating costs

📐 I already have drawings

👉 Selecting one creates a Project Draft silently.

STEP 2: LOCATION (Critical for pricing)

AI:

“Where is the project located?”

Options:

County dropdown

Area / estate (free text)

💡 This instantly sets:

Material pricing bands

Transport costs

County approvals logic

STEP 3: BUDGET ALIGNMENT (Trust Builder)

AI:

“What budget range are you working with?”

Buttons:

KSh 1M–2M

KSh 2M–4M

KSh 4M+

“Not sure yet”

⚠️ No judgement language. Ever.

STEP 4: BUILD DETAILS (Progressive)

AI asks only what’s necessary:

Floors (1 / 2+)

Timeline (rush / flexible)

Using a professional? (Yes / Need one)

Each answer updates the Project Intelligence Model.

STEP 5: CONFIRMATION MOMENT (Power Move)

AI:

“Got it. I’ve prepared a recommended materials and services list for your project.”
