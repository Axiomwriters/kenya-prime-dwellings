BUILDING MATERIALS SHOP

Project-Aware Marketplace (Chuma Mart but with a brain)

This isn’t e-commerce.
This is construction intelligence wrapped in clean UI.

1️⃣ THE FEEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before features: vibes.

Design language

Apple-clean, not hardware-store chaos

Soft neutrals (cement gray, off-white, charcoal)

One accent color (deep green or clay red = Kenyan, premium)

Motion = subtle, not circus

Micro-interaction philosophy

Every action acknowledges intent

No dead clicks

Everything slides, fades, expands — never jumps

If Webflow feels stiff → you overdid components.

2️⃣ SHOP PAGE STRUCTURE (SMART, NOT LOUD)
A. Top Section (Above the Fold)

Instead of “Shop Materials” 👎
You say:

Build smarter. Buy exactly what your project needs.

Below it:

Project selector dropdown
Active Project: 3-Bedroom Maisonette – Nakuru

Or CTA: Create a Project to unlock smart quantities

This sets context immediately.

B. Category Navigation (Sticky + Horizontal)

Not a sidebar.
Sidebars are old-money e-commerce.

Sticky horizontal scroll:

Cement & Aggregates

Steel

Roofing

Plumbing

Electrical

Finishing

Prefab

Active category gets a smooth underline animation.
No page reloads — just content morphing.

3️⃣ PRODUCT CARDS (THIS IS WHERE IQ SHOWS)

Each card is calm. No clutter.

Card Layout

Product image (neutral background)

Product name + spec

Price (per unit)

Supplier rating ⭐

Delivery coverage (county chips)

Stock status (green = available)

Primary CTA

🔥 Add to Project

Not “Add to Cart”. Ever.

Secondary (tiny):

View specs

Compare

4️⃣ THE KILLER: PROJECT-BASED CART 🧠🔥

Once user clicks Add to Project:

Slide-in Panel (Right Side)

This is key — do NOT redirect.

Panel shows:

Selected project

Auto-estimated quantity

Cost breakdown

Delivery estimate

Example:

Cement (50kg)
Estimated needed: 220 bags
Based on: 3-bedroom maisonette (150sqm)

User can:

Adjust quantities

Lock quantity (for pros)

Ask AI: “Why this amount?”

5️⃣ AUTO-QUANTITY LOGIC (YOUR SECRET SAUCE)

Quantities are calculated from:

Project type

Size (sqm)

Floors

Construction method

Example:

If project = Maisonette:

Cement

Steel

Hardcore

Ballast

Sand

Auto-bundled into a Material Set:

Foundation Materials
Superstructure Materials
Roofing Materials

Users feel like:

“Oh… this system knows what it’s doing.”

6️⃣ SMART SUGGESTIONS (WHERE AI EARNS ITS SALARY)

Below each product in cart:

“Cheaper alternative – save KSh 12,400”

“Higher quality – longer lifespan”

“Supplier closer to site – faster delivery”

You’re not upselling.
You’re advising.

That’s trust.

7️⃣ DELIVERY & TIMELINE VIEW

Inside the Project Cart:

Gantt-style delivery timeline

Materials grouped by delivery date

Warnings:

⚠️ Long lead item

⚠️ Stock low

This prevents site delays — huge pain point solved.

8️⃣ CHECKOUT (PROJECT-FIRST)

Checkout is project milestone based, not item based.

User chooses:

Deliver all at once

Phase deliveries

Hold in escrow until milestone

Payment summary:

Materials cost

Delivery

Platform fee (transparent)

Escrow protection badge

No surprises = higher conversion.

9️⃣ WEBFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (REAL TALK)
How to build this in Webflow without pain:

Collections

Products

Suppliers

Projects

Material Rules (AI-backed later)

Interactions

Slide-in panels (IX2)

Sticky nav

Dynamic filtering

Smooth state changes

Important
Webflow handles:

UI

CMS

Animations

Your backend (Supabase / Next / whatever):

Quantity logic

AI suggestions

Project linking

Payments

Don’t overburden Webflow with logic — let it shine visually.

10️⃣ WHY THIS WINS (NO SUGARCOATING)

Chuma Mart = inventory dump
You = construction intelligence

They sell materials.
You sell confidence + precision.

Once a user builds one project with you:

They won’t go back

Professionals will push clients here

Suppliers will beg to be listed
